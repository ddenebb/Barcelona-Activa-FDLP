/* This line of code: Math.ceil ((Math.random () * 10)); Returns a number between 0 and 10 at random.
The exercise is that the user has to guess the number chosen at random by the program.
The program prompts the user for numbers until the user guesses the random number generated by the program.
Once the user has guessed the number, the following message will be displayed on the screen: 
"Congratulations, the number was X"
